-Holes here and there players can fall through.
- Enemies spawning now and then who eats the floors(And any blocks placed by players)
- The more blocks, the more of them are spawned(To combat players placing)
- THe lower the boss is in health, the more spawn.
- Boss does percentage of damage that the highest player does to him.
- Boss has 5 stages. Each stage will add armour compareable to the damage output of the players
